# Sierpinky Triangle Generator
Sierpinky Triangle generator

A **triangle-base fractal**, i uses a triangle as a base to construct itself.

> How it works:
- *Randomly* selecting one of the blue cordinates, including the last one selected
- Calculating the *midle point* on the **X** and **Y** axis
- Draw a single white pixel on that cordinates

***It works by rounding the number when calculating cordinates, therefore, some pixel will be empty***
